The sorting algorithm I chose is Shell sort.
It is conceived from which the insertion sorting algorithm produces optimal performance in an array that is almost aligned.
The insertion sorting algorithm is first performed at a sparse interval, and as the gap gradually narrows,
the nearly aligned array is finally finished with an insertion sorting algorithm.
The algorithm itself is not a commonly used algorithm because the time complexity is not clear
and is not much better than quick or merge sorting.
The name shell alignment comes from the name of the developer Donald Shell.
